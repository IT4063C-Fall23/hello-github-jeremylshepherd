## Instructions
Make sure you follow the instructions carefully. You will be asked to complete a series of tasks and answer questions about your work. You will submit the assignment by submitting a link to your repository on Canvas.

> If you're reading this in a text editor, you may notice the `- [ ]` and `- [x]` characters. These are used to create checkboxes in Markdown. You can use them to keep track of your progress through the assignment.
### Checkpoint 1: Get the Starter Files on your Computer
- [x] Accept the assignment using GitHub Classroom. (if you see this on GitHub, then you've already done this step)
   - This step creates a repository for you on the class organization with the starter files the instructor has provided.
   - When the instructor creates the assignment on GitHub Classroom, they can configure the repository visibility setting: (public or private). Usually your assignments will be set to _private_ that way only you and the instructor can see your work.
   - > This assignment is set to _public_ so that you can see your classmates repositories and be able to collaborate with them. This is second part of the assignment (due next week).
- [ ] Clone the generated repository to your computer.
   - You can use GitHub Desktop, VS Code, or the command line to clone the repository.
  - If you don't know how you can do this, go back to the lecture videos for a demo of this process, or read ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=webui) on GitHub Docs.
    - **Notice:** towards the top of the Docs page, you can switch the instructions depending on your environment (command line, GitHub Desktop, ...etc.) and operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).

### Checkpoint 2: Update the Repository
  - Open the repository in your text editor (Ideally, VS Code).
  - [ ] **Adding New Files.**
    - Create a new file with the following name `intro.md` and paste in the following text (as is - do not modify it):
    
    ```
    # My Name
    Hello class, my name is [type your name], and I am a student at the University of [type the university name].
    ```
    - Commit your changes. Make sure you use a descriptive commit message. (e.g. "Created intro.md file")
    - no edit the file, adding your name and university in the appropriate places.
    - Make another commit with a descriptive message. (e.g. "Added my name and university to intro.md")
    - Push your changes to GitHub and confirm that your changes are there.
    > -  Remember the difference between committing and pushing. **Committing** is a local action, your local repository captures a new snapshot of the code changes made to the repo. **Pushing** is a remote action, where you upload all the snapshots/commits to your repo on GitHub. If you don't push, the instructor can't see your updates.
    - > You want to commit often; every complete thought/action can be a commit, but also don't forget to push especially at the end of your work.
  - [ ] **Editing Existing files.**
    - Open the `README.md` file, and fill out the Reflection and Self-Assessment Section.
    - Commit your changes. Make sure you use a descriptive commit message.
    - Push your changes to GitHub and confirm that your changes are there.

**Submit your work by submitting a link to your repository on Canvas.**
